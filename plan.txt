Interview Hub – Hackathon Plan
n Core Goal (Hackathon MVP)
Recruiter Practice Simulator: - User picks a company + role (or general practice). - AI recruiter (Gemini)
asks questions → ElevenLabs voices them. - User answers (typed for MVP). - AI recruiter grades
response with rubric → shows score + feedback. - (Optional) profile page shows progress.
n Team Roles
1 Person A – Frontend/UI Lead: Build pages (Home, Interview Session, Profile), components
(chat bubbles, scorecard), ElevenLabs audio integration.
2 Person B – Backend/API Lead: FastAPI routes (/sessions, /next, /answers, /grade, /complete),
MongoDB, Gemini + ElevenLabs integration.
3 Person C – AI/Prompt + Data Lead: Write Gemini prompts, seed company/role templates,
design grading rubric, tune AI feedback, mock analytics.
n 24-Hour Schedule
1 Hour 0–2: Setup repo, scaffold backend/frontend, draft prompts.
